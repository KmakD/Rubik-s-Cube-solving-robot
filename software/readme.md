The software core element is an solve_app application which, by using a camera allows to scan the state of a Rubikâ€™s Cube, then find algorithms capable of shuffling the puzzle's side to the desired state and solve it. Moves used to solve the cube are designated using the Kociemba algorithm, which allows finding a highly optimal solution. Cube sides can be scaned by pressing 'space' and should be oriented as folowed: for green, red, blue, orange - white side should face up; for white and yellow - red side should face right. To configure colours press 'enter' then adjust upper and lower HSV values for each colour using sliders. For proper working of aplication it is necessary to install kociemba library for Python./
To read algorithm sent by application and rotate desired stepper motors a microcontroller software was created (motor.ino or motors_par.ino which allows for simultaneous move of pararell sides).
